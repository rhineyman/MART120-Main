I found this short look into learning styles to be very interesting. I have always considered myself a hands on learner. I typically thrive when I am being taught in the moment how to complete a task. Usually after being shown the process once with supervision I can typically work on my own from there. I honestly did think that people were stuck in their own learning style so it was interesting to see the results of VARK testing. The majority of the people that took it, over seventy percent, did not employ the learning style they identified with. This was a very interesting thing to see as it does seem that learning styles are a myth for the average person. I really do like how this has changed my mindset on my personal learning style. I may have been rejecting other learning styles before giving them a real chance. I do think this is going to help my mentality as I move forward with my educational journey.
