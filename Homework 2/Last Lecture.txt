The last lecture was a very powerful talk on not stopping when you run into barriers. I have dealt with these issues many times in my own life. It is very difficult to stay on task when you run into obstacles. The only way we truly grow is when we run into adversity. Having this gentleman with a terminal disease listing off all of his accomplishments was very inspiring. Finding an environment you can thrive in can be a very difficult task. Not every situation you find yourself is going to be a positive place to reach your goals. With this being a real issue we need to find more ways to cultivate a positive culture around success and failure. Something I tell people all the time is "being really bad at something is the first step to being really good." Failure is inevitable while on the path for growth and discovery. How you deal with it is the real challenge.
